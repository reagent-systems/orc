## 1. Create a comparison document (e.g., a table or a report) summarizing the features, strengths, weaknesses, and use cases of each Python web framework based on the analysis.

### Result:

```tool_code
# Overall plan:
# The previous step should have created individual analysis files for each framework.
# This step is to consolidate that information into a single comparison document.
# The goal is to create a markdown document comparing the frameworks based on features, strengths, weaknesses, and use cases.
# Step 1: List the files in the framework_analysis directory to identify the analysis files.
# Step 2: Read each analysis file and extract relevant information.
# Step 3: Consolidate information into a comparison document.
# Step 4: Write the comparison document to a file.

# Detailed plan:
# Step 1: List files in framework_analysis directory.
# Operation: file_operations.list
# Step 2: Read each analysis file and extract relevant information.
# For each file from step 1:
#   Operation: file_operations.read
#   Extract: Features, Strengths, Weaknesses, Use Cases
# Step 3: Consolidate information into a comparison document.
# Create a markdown table with the extracted information.
# Step 4: Write the comparison document to a file.
# Operation: file_operations.write

# Step 1: List files in framework_analysis directory.
file_list = file_operations.list(path="framework_analysis")
print(file_list)

## 2. Compare the current implementation with the documented best practices identified in step 2. Identify areas where the current implementation deviates from best practices.

### Result:

Okay, I will compare the current implementation with the documented best practices and identify any deviations. To do this, I need to first read the relevant files to understand the current implementation. Then, I'll compare it against the best practices (which I assume are stored in a file or accessible via some means). Finally, I will report the differences.

Here's my plan:

1.  **Identify relevant files:** Based on the context, I'll try to identify the core files related to the multi-agent system's implementation. This might include agent classes, communication modules, orchestration logic, etc. I'll make educated guesses and use `file_operations.list` if necessary to explore the file system.
2.  **Read relevant files:** I will use `file_operations.read` to read the content of the identified files.
3.  **Access best practices:** I'll need to know where the "documented best practices" are stored.  Since this information isn't directly provided, I'll assume they are in a file named `best_practices.txt` in the root directory.  If this file doesn't exist, I'll report that I cannot proceed without access to the best practices document.
4.  **Compare and Identify Deviations:** I'll analyze the code from the read files and compare it to the best practices.
5.  **Report Deviations:** I'll provide a clear and concise report outlining the areas where the current implementation deviates from the documented best practices.

Let's start with step 1: Identifying relevant files. I'll assume a standard ADK-like structure.

```tool_code
file_operations.list(path=".")
```

## 3. Analyze the information gathered in the previous step to identify key features, strengths, weaknesses, and target use cases for each framework.

**Task ID:** `86f0876b-2296-4a8b-b837-0b3989fd602f`
**Source:** context
**Created:** 2025-06-30T00:37:33.166741

### Result:

Okay, I will analyze the information gathered in the previous step to identify key features, strengths, weaknesses, and target use cases for each framework. I will then generate a comparison document.

First, I need to access the files created in the previous step and read their contents. I assume these files contain information about the different Python web frameworks. I'll start by listing the files in the research directory to identify the relevant files.

```tool_code
file_operations.list(path="research")
```
