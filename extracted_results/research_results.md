## 2. Search for 'Python best practices' on Google

**Task ID:** `61a56ad6-3457-423c-9ef7-62991fa75a78`
**Source:** context
**Created:** 2025-06-30T00:36:02.264397

### Result:

Here's a summary of Python best practices based on the search results:

**Code Style and Readability:**

*   **PEP 8 Adherence:** Follow PEP 8 guidelines for formatting and structuring code, including indentation (4 spaces), line length (maximum 79 characters), and blank lines.
*   **Naming Conventions:** Use descriptive and concise variable names. Follow Python's naming conventions: `snake_case` for variables and functions, `CamelCase` for classes, and `UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES` for constants. Avoid overly general or worldly names.
*   **Line Length:** Limit lines to a maximum of 79 characters to enhance readability, especially on smaller screens.
*   **Indentation:** Use 4 spaces for each indentation level to define code blocks.  Avoid mixing tabs and spaces; use spaces consistently.
*   **Blank Lines:** Use blank lines to separate top-level functions and class definitions (two blank lines) and method definitions within a class (one blank line).
*   **Imports:** Place imports at the top of the file, grouped in this order: standard library, third-party, and local application/library-specific imports.

**Code Structure and Efficiency:**

*   **DRY Principle:**  Don't Repeat Yourself. Avoid redundant code by using functions and loops.
*   **Virtual Environments:** Use virtual environments to manage dependencies on a per-project basis, preventing conflicts between packages.
*   **Built-in Functions & Libraries:** Leverage Python's built-in functions and libraries for efficiency and to reduce errors. Built-in features are often optimized for performance.
*   **List Comprehensions and Generator Expressions:** Use these for a concise way to create lists and generators. They can be faster and use less memory than equivalent code written in loops.
*   **Constants:** Use all caps for constants.

**Testing and Documentation:**

*   **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests to ensure code reliability.
*   **Meaningful Comments and Docstrings:** Use comments and docstrings to explain code purpose and functionality. Follow PEP 257's docstring guidelines. Use action words in docstrings (e.g., "Return").
*   **Testing:** Test ruthlessly.  Write tests as scenarios.

**General Principles:**

*   **"Explicit is better than implicit"**:  (from PEP 20).
*   **"Readability counts"**: (from PEP 20). Python code should be easy to read and understand.
*   **"Simple is better than complex"**: Prefer simple solutions over complex ones.
*   **Error Handling:** Handle exceptions gracefully to prevent crashes.
*   **Logging:** Use logs instead of print statements for debugging and monitoring. Use the `logging` module and choose the logging level wisely.

To further refine your understanding, consider exploring these topics:

*   **Linters and Autoformatters:** Use tools like `flake8` and `black` to automatically enforce code style and identify potential issues.
*   **More in-depth learning resources:** Explore resources to deepen your understanding of Python and its applications.
*   **Security Best Practices:**  Specifically for data engineering tasks, research security best practices.
*   **CI/CD:**  Learn about Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipelines.
