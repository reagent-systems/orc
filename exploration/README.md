# Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) Exploration

This exploration folder contains comprehensive documentation and analysis of Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK), an open-source framework for building, evaluating, and deploying sophisticated AI agents.

## What is ADK?

The Agent Development Kit (ADK) is a flexible and modular framework designed to empower developers to build, manage, evaluate, and deploy AI-powered agents. It provides a robust environment for creating both conversational and non-conversational agents capable of handling complex tasks and workflows.

Key characteristics:
- **Code-first approach**: Direct programmatic definition of agent behavior
- **Multi-agent systems**: Support for hierarchical agent collaboration
- **Model-agnostic**: Works with various LLMs beyond Google's ecosystem
- **Deployment-agnostic**: Can be deployed anywhere from local to cloud
- **Framework compatibility**: Built for compatibility with other frameworks

## Folder Structure

### Core Framework
- **[adk-overview/](./adk-overview/)** - Fundamental concepts, installation, and setup
- **[agents/](./agents/)** - Different types of agents (LLM, Workflow, Custom, Multi-agent)
- **[tools/](./tools/)** - Tool integration and development
- **[models/](./models/)** - Model integration and configuration

### Features & Capabilities
- **[streaming/](./streaming/)** - Real-time streaming capabilities for voice/video
- **[sessions-memory/](./sessions-memory/)** - Session management and memory systems
- **[mcp-integration/](./mcp-integration/)** - Model Context Protocol integration

### Development & Deployment
- **[tutorials/](./tutorials/)** - Hands-on tutorials and quickstart guides
- **[evaluation/](./evaluation/)** - Agent evaluation and testing
- **[deployment/](./deployment/)** - Deployment options and strategies

## Key Capabilities

1. **Multi-Agent System Design**: Build applications with multiple specialized agents
2. **Rich Tool Ecosystem**: Integrate custom functions, APIs, and external services
3. **Flexible Orchestration**: Define workflows using built-in agents or LLM-driven routing
4. **Native Streaming Support**: Real-time bidirectional text and audio streaming
5. **Built-in Evaluation**: Assess agent performance systematically
6. **Broad LLM Support**: Works with Gemini, Claude, OpenAI, and other models
7. **Artifact Management**: Handle files and binary data
8. **State and Memory Management**: Manage conversational context and long-term memory

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**: See [adk-overview/installation-setup.md](./adk-overview/installation-setup.md)
2. **Core Concepts**: Read [adk-overview/core-concepts.md](./adk-overview/core-concepts.md)
3. **First Agent**: Follow [tutorials/quickstart-tutorial.md](./tutorials/quickstart-tutorial.md)
4. **Agent Types**: Explore [agents/](./agents/) directory

## Architecture Philosophy

ADK is built around key primitives:
- **Agent**: Fundamental worker units for specific tasks
- **Tool**: Capabilities beyond conversation (APIs, code execution, etc.)
- **Session**: Context management for conversations
- **Event**: Communication units between components
- **Runner**: Execution engine that orchestrates interactions
