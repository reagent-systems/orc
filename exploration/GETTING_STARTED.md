## 📚 Quick Reference

### Core Components
- **Agent**: Fundamental unit that processes requests and generates responses
- **Tool**: Extends agent capabilities (APIs, functions, external services)
- **Session**: Manages conversation context and state
- **Runner**: Orchestrates agent execution and handles infrastructure
- **Event**: Communication units between components

### Agent Types
- **LlmAgent**: Powered by language models for reasoning tasks
- **SequentialAgent**: Executes sub-agents in order
- **ParallelAgent**: Runs sub-agents concurrently
- **LoopAgent**: Iterative processing with termination conditions
- **Custom Agents**: Specialized logic for unique requirements

### Key Patterns
- **Coordinator/Dispatcher**: Route requests to specialized agents
- **Sequential Pipeline**: Multi-step processing workflows
- **Parallel Fan-Out**: Concurrent execution with result aggregation
- **Hierarchical Decomposition**: Break complex tasks into simpler steps
- **Review/Critique**: Generation followed by quality assessment
